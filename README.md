# Digital-marketplace
This is a research project to establish a digital marketplace platform that enables Buyers and Suppliers to connect. 

# Problem Statement
Develop a recommendation algorithm for a digital marketplace platform that connects New Zealand public sector agencies (buyers) with various suppliers (sellers) by providing personalized and relevant product or service suggestions. The algorithm should effectively incorporate Future Procurement Opportunities to help suppliers better prepare for and align with upcoming demands from public sector agencies.

## The algorithm aims to:

1. Take into account users' preferences, behavior, and past interactions on the platform, considering both buyers' and sellers' perspectives.
2. Utilize item similarity, collaborative filtering, and popularity to generate recommendations that cater to the specific needs of public sector agencies.
3. Leverage Future Procurement Opportunities to assist suppliers in anticipating upcoming demands and adjusting their offerings accordingly.
4. Consider seasonality, trending items, and inventory levels when recommending products or services.
5. Balance the recommendations with a mix of in-network (suppliers the agency has previously worked with) and out-of-network sources (new or undiscovered suppliers) to promote diversity and discoverability.
6. Continuously learn and adapt to user feedback and engagement metrics to optimize recommendations, ensuring that the platform remains up-to-date and responsive to the needs of both public sector agencies and suppliers.
With this refined problem statement, we can better focus on building a recommendation algorithm tailored to the specific needs of your digital marketplace platform, connecting New Zealand public sector agencies with suitable suppliers.
